        "Chief_Complaint": "Occasional discomfort in neck and back after car accident.",
        "History_of_Present_Illness": "Ms. Jones was involved in a car accident on September 1st, where she was rear-ended while stopped in traffic. She experienced immediate pain in her neck and back after hitting her head on the steering wheel. Initially, she sought medical attention at Moss Bank Accident and Emergency, where she was diagnosed with a whiplash injury but did not receive X-rays. The first four weeks post-accident were difficult, with significant neck and back pain, trouble sleeping, and reliance on painkillers. After ten sessions of physiotherapy, her condition improved, and she now experiences occasional backaches, which are much less severe than before. She reports no anxiety while driving or emotional issues related to the accident and has returned to her usual routine after taking a week off work."
