I was driving from Cheadle Hulme to Manchester when I had to stop in traffic . out of nowhere, another car hit me from behind , which pushed my car into the one in front . that sounds like a strong impact . what did you feel immediately after the accident? Yes, I went to Moss Bank Accident and Emergency . they checked me over and said it was a whiplash injury , but they didn\u00e2\u20acTMt do any X-rays . the first four weeks were rough . my neck and back pain were really bad ."
